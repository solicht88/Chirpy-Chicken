Solo project for Jamhacks9.  

## What I Learned  
I decided I wanted to be ambitious with my project, using technology I'd never tried before.  
- Set up Firebase and Gemini's GenAI API for the first time  
- First project I made that does not rely on local host or GitHub pages  

Though I spent hours trying to configure and fix errors from both Firebase and Gemini, this project taught me more about full-stack development.  

## Future Goals  
This project is made with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. AI tools such as GitHub Co-pilot and Gemini were used in the production of code.  
Going forward, I plan to learn more frontend tools (React, Vite, and Tailwind), as well as how to set up and use servers for the backend.
