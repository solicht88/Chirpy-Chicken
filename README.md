# üêì Chripy Chicken  
Chirpy Chicken is an AI chicken friend that you can send messages to!  
This chicken even as a button that generates a social situation for you, then gives feedback based on your response.  
Solo project for Jamhacks9.  

## What I Learned  
I decided I wanted to be ambitious with my project this time, using technologhy I've never tried before.  
From this project, I learned to use Firebase and Gemini's GenAI API for the first time.  
This is also the first project I made that does not rely on local host or GitHub.  
Although I struggled a lot, spending hours to configure and fix errors from Firebase, I learned a lot and hope I can further improve my full stack skills.  
Setting up API requests 

## Future Goals  
This project is made with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. AI tools such as GitHub Co-pilot and Gemini were used in the production of cdoe.  
Going forward, I plan to learn more frontend tools, such as Vite and Tailwind, as well as learn how to set up and use servers for backend.
