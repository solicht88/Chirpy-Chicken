ooochicken is an AI chicken friend that supports you and helps to practice social skills!  
Solo project for Jamhacks9.  

## What I Learned  
I am not very experienced in building more complex projects, but decided to use the long weekend as an opportunity to push my learning.  
In this project, I learned to use Firebase and Gemini API for the first time.  
Going forward in frontend, I am looking to strengthen my understanding in CSS, then learn React, Vite, and Tailwind in order to improve my projects.
